sudo adduser alice
sudo adduser bob
sudo adduser carol
sudo addgroup project2021
sudo usermod -a -G project2021 alice
sudo usermod -a -G project2021 bob
sudo chown alice project
cd /home/alice
sudo chown -R alice project (making alice user/owner of all files/directories inside project folder)
sudo chgrp -R project2021 project (making project2021 group of all files/directories inside project folder)
(alice now is the user/owner, project2021 is the group containing alice and bob, carol is outsider)
Permissions of user overwrite group permissions, that is, if a group cannot write a file, but a user in that group,
if allowed to write a file, can write a file (overwrites group permissions)

type: u: user, g: group, o: others (those logged in but not user nor in the group)
evaluator: =: overwrite permission, +: add permission, -: deny permission
permission: r: read, w: write, x: execute

formula 
sudo chmod typeEvaluatorPermission file // to change the permission

for example
sudo chmod u=rwx project (gives user aka alice permission to read, write and cd to project folder)
sudo chmod o=r-x project (gives others logged in permission to read or cd project, but not write)
sudo chmod o=--- (others have no permission at all to project folder)
sudo chmod g+r project (give group permission to read)
sudo chmod u-w project (deny user permission to write)


ls -l (listing permissions and owner and group for all files) (use this freqeuntly to check status of permissions)

for project folder, it should look like this
total 4
drwxrwxr-x 4 alice project2021 4096 Sep 14 13:54 project
d is directory, - is file, first three rwx is user permission, next three rwx is group permission, next three 
r-x is other permission, 4 is number of directories pointing to the inode
alice is the owner/user, project2021 is thr group that owns the file, project is the diretory owned by alice and the group

Inside project, it should be like this
total 280
drwxrwx--- 2 alice project2021   4096 Sep 14 12:44 code
drwx------ 2 alice project2021   4096 Sep 14 12:44 confidential
-rwxrwxr-x 1 alice project2021   8600 Sep 14 12:44 poc
-rw-rw-r-- 1 alice project2021 262760 Sep 14 12:44 product10.pdf

inside code subdirectory, it should be like this
-rw-rw-rwx 1 alice project2021  73 Sep 14 12:44 Makefile
-rw-rw-rwx 1 alice project2021 131 Sep 14 12:44 poc.c

inside confidential subdirectory, it should be like this
-rw-rwxrwx 1 alice project2021 83 Sep 14 12:44 plan.txt

Note: since others cant have any permissions in code and confidential folders, it cannot do anything on these folders
files and subdirectories as well, despite having permission in those files. 
=> permission of parent folders overwrites individual permissions of files and subdirectories inside
